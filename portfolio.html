    <h2>Business Card and Healthy Recipe Apps</h2>

    <h2>Rock, Paper, Scissors game</h2>
    <p>Description:I was looking for a side project to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I saw a recommendation for a simple rock, paper, scissors game. This was a fun weekend project I did in my downtime to practice using JavaScript mostly but to also get some CSS practice in. The game simply allows the user to pick between three options obviously being rock, paper, or scissors. The user is then randomly put against an output and according to the gameâ€™s rule they will receive a message if they won or lost. I saw a tutorial that helped with icons and keeping the score as well.</p>
