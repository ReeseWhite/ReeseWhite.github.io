            <h5>Student <span>Developer</span></h5>
      <p>Hello! My name is Reese White. I’m a senior studying Information Communication Technology. I am interested in Web Development and potentially Database Management. My skills are heavily focused around HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, and of course SQL. However, I am still refining and improving on more skills to be a well-rounded developer. I am fascinated by technology and love to explore and learn about the different branches within it.</p>
