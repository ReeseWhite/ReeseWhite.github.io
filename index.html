  <p>Hello! My name is Reese White. I’m a senior studying Information Communication Technology.</p>
  <p>I am interested in Web Development and potentially Database Management.</p>
  <p>My skills are heavily focused around HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, and of course SQL.<p>
  <p>However, I am still refining and improving on more skills to be a well-rounded developer.</p>
  <p>I am fascinated by technology and love to explore and learn about the different branches within it.</p>
